**Shop API**
 
The shop api exposes the services to the shop application.
It is organised as a proxy and some common classes should be added to its definition.

This api serves the needs of
* the Shop Owner (GÃ©rant)
* the Seller (vendeur, vendeuse)

This api interacts with the lower level services to deal with:
* **the shop orders** - the shops can make orders to laboratories on a daily basis. 

* **the customer orders** - customers can use shops to pass their orders. These orders are special orders and differ from the daily shop orders.

* **the product catalog** - the shops get information from the main product catalog

* **the laboratory stock** - it might be possible for the shop application to query the state of the stock to check if an order is feasible or not.
